I enjoy meeting with students. If you'd like to meet with me, feel free to schedule a 15-minute appointment [here](https://calendar.app.google/ng9bAncJt3aeAPNv6). I periodically add more slots, so don't fret if there currently aren't any available. Graduate students should feel free to book two consecutive 15-minute slots if needed. *By default, office hours will be in my office,* but I am happy to meet virtually as well. *The sign-up form has a box to provide a Zoom link if you'd like to meet virtually.* I look forward to talking with you!

I also hold a weekly open Zoom office hours for Econ 1630 students. Please check the syllabus on Canvas for details.
