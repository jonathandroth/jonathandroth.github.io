I am the Groos Family Assistant Professor of Economics at Brown University. (I will be an associate professor with tenure as of July 1, 2025.)

My primary research interests are in econometrics, with a focus on causal inference. I have also worked on topics in labor economics and algorithmic fairness.

I was previously a senior researcher in the Office of the Chief Economist at Microsoft. I received my PhD in economics in 2020 from Harvard, where I was awarded the David A. Wells prize for best dissertation. I obtained a BA *summa cum laude* in mathematics and economics from the University of Pennsylvania.
